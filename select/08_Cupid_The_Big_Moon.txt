I'm gonna get this perfectly right
I'm gonna get this perfectly right
I've been trying to catch an eye for a lifetime

I'm gonna get this perfectly right
He said, "I'm gonna shoot the perfect bull's eye."
Draw the arrow back
Steal yourself
Tighten the string on the bow

Sorry I'm not your guy
Sorry I'm not your guy
Sorry I'm not
Oooh I've been waiting for a girl like you
Oooh I'm not ready for the change

I'm gonna get this perfectly right
He said, "I'm gonna make the Earth shake tonight."
Pineapple juice, tropical rubicon courage
Yeah, baby take my wallet, my round
See my jonny artfully tucked out
Draw the arrow back
Steal yourself
Tighten the string on your bow, go
Oooh I've been waiting for a girl like you
Oooh I'm not ready for the change

Time to turn and run from romance
I'm backing out
Hit the target
Hit the target another time

Sorry I'm not your guy
Sorry I'm not
Oooh I've been waiting for a girl like you
Oooh I'm not ready for the change
Oooh I've been waiting for a girl like you
Oooh I'm not ready for the change
