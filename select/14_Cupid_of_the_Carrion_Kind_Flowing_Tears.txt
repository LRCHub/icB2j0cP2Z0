There in the dark it's the only abuse
Walking frail to the guardian light
There in the dark where the road is a fuse

And he said...
Will you be a light for me
To seduce to elude to grin?
Will you be a light for me
Walking in for a holy sin?

There in the dark it's the only abuse
That I can't get out of his sight
There in the dark it's the only abuse
When the frail old man he smiles

And he says...
Will you be a bride for me
On your knees for a second run?
Will you shoot the sky for me
Stealing streetlight just for fun?

I cannot see your sun so far away
I cannot be four lightyears far away
I cannot see your sky so far away
I cannot see your light another day

There in the dark -
Ten years older and wise
Still there's a frail, frail guardian light
There in the dark - back to preach of the night
See the face of the old man is mine

...gaze of the old man is mine
